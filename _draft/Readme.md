README

https://changelog.com/posts/a-beginners-guide-to-creating-a-readme

A readme isn't always the best place to talk about your project. A readme's scope should really be pretty limited to:

* What is it?: Does this project solve my problem? If so, how?
* How do I use it?

Anything else---like, "Why I Wrote This Module" or "Addressing Criticisms Of My Module"---don't really fit. But, blog posts are a great way of getting this information out.
